// Android's Back key. The webview goes back through its own history before the activity sees the
// key (and MainActivity sends the app to the background), so every level of "something to go back
// from" gets a history entry for the key to use up. With none left, Back leaves the app.
//
// Entries are only ever added as a level opens, never after a Back: the webview's goBack skips an
// entry whose page then added another without a tap, which would drop Back straight out of the app.
